============

The objective of this lab is to introduce the environment we will be building our code in for the lab portion of this class. Since the majority of our testing environment will be using Java, students are given links to review Java and Eclipse. A very common testing tool that is conveniently integrated into the Eclipse IDE is JUnit.
